  | For kicks I"ve designed a business card for myself, mostly because I wanted to try out a real world application of QR codes. Whenever you receive a card from anybody you would actually like to contact again, you have to arduously enter his/her information. With a QR code you can scan the card and immediately send the

  | &nbsp;to your phone address book.

  | For my further amusement I also decided to create the cards using SVG. With no decent editor on hand, and since I wanted to familiarize myself with the standard, I decided to write them by hand (not withstanding the QR code, which was
