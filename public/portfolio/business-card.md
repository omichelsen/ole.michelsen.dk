For kicks I've designed a business card for myself, mostly because I wanted to try out a real world application of QR codes. Whenever you receive a card from anybody you would actually like to contact again, you have to arduously enter his/her information. With a QR code you can scan the card and immediately send the [vCard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard) to your phone address book.

<div class="column-left c">

_Front_
</div>
<div class="column-right c">
    [![Back](/portfolio/business-card/card-back.svg)](/portfolio/business-card/card-back.svg)

_Back_
</div>

For my further amusement I also decided to create the cards using SVG. With no decent editor on hand, and since I wanted to familiarize myself with the standard, I decided to write them by hand (not withstanding the QR code, which was [created with a tool](http://www.quickmark.cn/en/qrcode-datamatrix-generator/?qrVCard)). The result is fairly simple, but very scalable and portable.
