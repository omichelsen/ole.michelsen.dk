      We developed this in a small team in Copenhagen, with the goal of rethinking how video conference meetings worked, and making it much easier to use and understand for first time users.

      Built with AngularJS and Node.js on a SaaS platform using GitHub, Firebase, Heroku, LogEntries, CircleCI, Amazon AWS/S3 and many more. Video and audio is delivered through peer-to-peer via WebRTC with support for screen sharing, chat and document sharing.
