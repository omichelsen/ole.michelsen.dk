    [glry](https://github.com/omichelsen/glry) is an open source image gallery plug-in. I needed a gallery that was mobile-first and could load the images given a function. But every plug-in I looked at required the images to be known/loaded beforehand, which is not optimal for large galleries on a slow or metered connection.

    So I created glry which support touch events on mobile, where you can swipe and drag the image to go to the next/previous, and tap the screen to see a navigation menu. On the desktop keyboard navigation is supported with the arrow keys.

    You can try the demo above, or open the [demo in full screen](https://rawgit.com/omichelsen/glry/master/demo/index.html).

    ### daily-glry

    I have also made the [daily-glry](https://github.com/omichelsen/daily-glry) extension, which is intended for daily comic galleries, e.g. a daily Dilbert or Calvin & Hobbes cartoon. It extends glry and can also go to today's date and jump to a random comic if you shake your device.

    Both plug-ins are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/omichelsen/glry), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=glry) and [Bower](http://bower.io/search/?q=glry).
