  | As lead developer of all Sandberg's websites, I have handled both architectural and graphical design, and programmed their systems from the ground up. The first versions of the primary website were based on ASP 3.0 and an MS Access database. Most everything has been changed since then, and now all systems are running ASP.NET 4.0, AJAX and LINQ with MS SQL Server.
