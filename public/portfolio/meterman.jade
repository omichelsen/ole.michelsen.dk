p I developed this system to help small and medium shops manage their <a href='sandberg.html'>Sandberg</a> products and organize them on the racks, that Sandberg delivers. The interface is based heavily on AJAX for front end features, which is using a special algorithm I developed in C# for automatically calculating the best placement of the products.

p The MeterMan system is intended for direct embedding on a vendors own website in an iframe, and is therefore kept in a minimalistic design. Shop functionality is also offered, with the option of full integration/redirect to the vendors basket or shipping of an e-mail order for simpler setups.
