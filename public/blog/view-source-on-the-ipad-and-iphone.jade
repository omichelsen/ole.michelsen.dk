  | : As of iOS 9 this bookmarklet doesn't work reliably anymore. Any suggestions to fix it are most welcome.

p As a web developer I'm frequently looking at the source code of various websites. Lately my new iPad has become my primary tool for surfing and reading documentation, but alas it completely lacks a view source feature.

p A fine solution is to create a bookmarklet, which is a piece of JavaScript saved as a bookmark. When you want to see the source of a web page, just click the bookmark and the source of the page is displayed. I was inspired by <a title="iPad View Source Bookmarklet" href="http://www.ravelrumba.com/blog/ipad-view-source-bookmarklet/" target="_blank">this bookmarklet by Rob Flaherty</a>, but it has a few shortcomings. To improve upon the bookmarklet concept, I created my own version with a few more bells and whistles:

// more

ul
  li The code is syntax highlighted (using <a title="GeSHi - Generic Syntax Highlighter" href="http://qbnz.com/highlighter/" target="_blank">GeSHi</a>)
  li Links are clickable, so you can follow scripts etc.
  li Text is fully selectable

.image-attachment
  a(href="/images/blog/view-source-on-the-ipad-and-iphone/Bookmark.png")
    img(
      title="View Source Bookmarklet"
      alt="Clicking the bookmarklet will display the source of the web page"
      src="/images/blog/view-source-on-the-ipad-and-iphone/Bookmark.png"
      width="564"
      height="300"
    )

h2 The code

p The following bookmarklet code basically posts the entire <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> to my server, which then takes care of business server-side:

pre
  code.language-javascript
    include ../viewsource/bookmarklet.js

h2 How to install it

p To add it on your computer and sync it to your iPad, just drag this link to your bookmarks:

p.indent
  a(
    href="javascript:(function(){var w=window.open('about:blank'),d=w.document;d.write('<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Loading Source</title></head><body></body></html>'),d.close();var f=d.createElement('form');f.setAttribute('method','post'),f.setAttribute('action','https://ole.michelsen.dk/viewsource/?uri='+encodeURIComponent(location.href));var i=d.createElement('input');i.setAttribute('type','hidden'),i.setAttribute('name','DOM'),i.setAttribute('value',encodeURIComponent(document.documentElement.innerHTML)),d.body.appendChild(f).appendChild(i),f.submit();})()"
    title="View Source Bookmarklet"
  )
    | View Source
  em &nbsp;(click to try it out)

p To add it directly from your iPad (or iPhone), you need to create the bookmark manually:

ol
  li Add this page as a bookmark
  li Then <a href="https://ole.michelsen.dk/viewsource/bookmarklet.min.js">click here to see the bookmarklet code</a> and Select All → Copy
  li Now edit that same bookmark, paste the code you just copied into the URL and name it something like "View Source"

p Voilá!

p Note that the source shown is the generated <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>, and not the original HTML. These might differ depending on the amount of JavaScript used on the page.

h3 Deploy your own server

p By popular demand, I have <a title="Bookmarklet server-side source code (PHP)" href="https://github.com/omichelsen/View-Source" target="_blank">published the server-side PHP code to GitHub</a>, so you can modify or host your own version of the bookmarklet. Remember that <a title="GeSHi - Generic Syntax Highlighter" href="http://qbnz.com/highlighter/" target="_blank">GeSHi</a> is required.
