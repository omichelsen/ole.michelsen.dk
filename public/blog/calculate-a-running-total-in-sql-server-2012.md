<img class="entry-image" title="Running total" src="/images/blog/calculate-a-running-total-in-sql-server-2012/running-total.png" alt="" width="180" height="107"> In the previous versions of SQL Server, calculating a running total for say, a bank account ledger, has been a frustratingly complex task. Fortunately [SQL Server 2012](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/) makes this a breeze with new support for windowed aggregate functions.

In this test example weâ€™ll be creating a running total for an imaginary ledger using the OVER clause with SUM (you can get the entire [test script here](https://gist.github.com/omichelsen/fbddc2ee9fefc40aba65)):

    SELECT a.id, a.account, a.deposit, SUM(a.deposit) OVER (ORDER BY a.id) AS 'total'
        FROM #TestData a
        ORDER BY a.id;

You can even do a running total for each account separately using the PARTITION clause:

    SELECT a.id, a.account, a.deposit, SUM(a.deposit) OVER (PARTITION BY a.account ORDER BY a.id) AS 'total'
        FROM #TestData a
        ORDER BY a.id;

## SQL Server 2005 and 2008

For those still stuck on older versions of SQL Server, the solution is a little less straightforward. There are a lot of techniques, but I have found the best performance using a recursive CTE (Common Table Expression), a feature added in SQL Server 2005.

    ;WITH cte AS (
        SELECT id, account, deposit, deposit AS 'total'
            FROM #TestData
            WHERE id = 1

        UNION ALL

        SELECT a.id, a.account, a.deposit, cte.total + a.deposit
            FROM cte JOIN #TestData a ON cte.id + 1 = a.id
    )
    SELECT * FROM cte
    OPTION (MAXRECURSION 32767);

There is one caveat though, since CTEs can do at most 32767 recursions. So if you have more records than that, you must fall back on the old sub-select:

    SELECT a.*, (SELECT SUM(b.deposit) FROM #TestData b WHERE b.id <= a.id) AS 'total'
        FROM #TestData a
