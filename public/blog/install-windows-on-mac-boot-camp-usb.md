Intel Macs have always been able to run Windows in parallel, and it's is even officially supported by Apple by the grace of Boot Camp, which makes a partition and boot disc for you with the necessary drivers.

If you have an older Mac, you might have some trouble using Boot Camp in the newer versions of MacOS, Yosemite and onwards. For some reason Apple has crippled Boot Camp to now allow making a bootable USB stick with Windows from an image. Since the optical SuperDrive in my Mac recently quit on me (and because USB is much better), this has lead me around the murky corners of message boards in search for a solution, which I now share with you all here.

Of course beware that this is not an offical Apple support guide. Use at your own discretion and do backups etc, etc.

## Make a bootable USB flash drive

First you need a USB flash drive of __8 GB__ or more. Then you need to start Boot Camp Assistant:

![Boot Camp Assistant should give you the option to create a Windows install USB flash drive from an ISO image, by presenting you with the option 'Create a Windows 7 or later version install disk'.](/images/blog/install-windows-on-mac-boot-camp-usb/boot-camp-assistant.png)

The first menu point should be "Create  a Windows 7 or later version install disk". If your screen _doesn't_ look like this, you have to do some ninja stuff. To convince Boot Camp Assistant that you are grown enough to use ISO images, follow these steps:

1. Go to Applications > Utilities > Boot Camp Assistant and right click to Show Package Contents
2. Edit the file `Info.plist` with XCode
3. Under the key `USBBootSupportedModels` add your Mac model.
   - To see your model version open ï£¿ > About This Mac > System Report and copy the first part of "Boot ROM Version" e.g. "MBP81".

![Look up the 'Boot ROM Version' entry in System Report to find your Mac model version.](/images/blog/install-windows-on-mac-boot-camp-usb/system-report.png)

Finally you have to codesign Boot Camp Assistant or it will crash on run. Open the terminal and run this command:

```bash
$ sudo codesign -fs - /Applications/Utilities/Boot\ Camp\ Assistant.app
```

You might be asked to download a developer tool from Apple, which is fine. You do not have to download all of XCode. After installation you might have to open a new Terminal windows and run the command again.

## Can't use Boot Camp partition

Now you have come all this way, but it might not be over just yet, if you are met by this pesky error message:

> Windows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk has an MBR partition table. On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed GPT disks.

1. Use Bootcamp to create EFI-bootable USB drive with the Windows ISO file.
2. Uninstall any previous installations of Bootcamp, restoring the partition table to one big Apple partitition.
3. Use Disk Utility in OS X to create empty space of the size I want my Windows partitition to be.
4. Reboot the machine to the USB drive.
5. Using the Windows Advanced partition options, create a new partition in the empty space. Windows will also create a small (128 MB or so) partition alongside it.
6. Format the new partition using the Windows Advanced partition options.
7. Proceed with installation onto that NTFS partition as before.
8. Windows 8 installs!
9. After installation, run the setup.exe inside the Bootcamp folder on the USB drive. This will install all the necessary device drivers.

## Final tip: fan control

If you have installed an SSD in your old Mac, the heat sensors in the harddrive will no longer be what the system expects, and thus the fans are spinning at max to protect the hardware. Because it's nice to retain your hearing, you can install the wonderful [Macs Fan Control](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zdc40r7zch4mq4m/Screenshot%202015-06-24%2009.47.07.png?dl=0) app and set system to watch for another sensor, e.g. the S.M.A.R.T one in your SSD.
