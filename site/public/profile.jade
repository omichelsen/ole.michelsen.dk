  h2 About me
  p
    | My full name is Ole Bjørn Michelsen. I'm a software developer based in Copenhagen, and in recent years I have primarily been developing large scale websites and back end database solutions.
  p
    | In 2010 I achieved a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen (
    a(href='http://www.diku.dk/', rel='external') DIKU
    span.diku-small
    | ), and concurrently I have worked both part and full time as a web developer. This website is intended to show off some of
    a(href='/portfolio/') my work and projects
    | .
  h3 Current projects
  p
    | Right now I'm looking into the many new features of HTML5 and CSS3, and especially how these can help to
    a(href='/portfolio/site-optimization.html') optimize website design and performance
    | .
    br
    | A friend and I are also trying out the more advanced aspects, such as WebSockets and the canvas element. We have so far created a rudimentary multiplayer Tetris game, where two players can battle against each other, using special blocks for attack and defense. I hope to get a working version online sometime this year.

  h2 Experience
  p
    | I'm mainly using ASP.NET, C#, LINQ, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Microsoft SQL Server and Transact-SQL in my daily work, but I'm always exploring other languages and techniques. Below is a simple diagram of my experience with the most commonly used languages.
  p
    | I have also developed for several different platforms. At the university we were using Linux, but in my work I have almost exclusively been developing on and for Windows. For this website and my private projects, I am primarily using Mac OS.
    br
    | In my mind there is no
    i one
    | solution that fits all, rather it's a matter of selecting the right tool for the job, thus getting experience with as many technologies as possible, is paramount when choosing the best solution.
