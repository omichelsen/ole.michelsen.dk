		<p><a href="http://www.hnp.dk" hreflang="da" rel="external">Hillerød NetParty (HNP)</a> was an association located in Hillerød, with the purpose of hosting <abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr>/netparties for members, where they could meet to play games and participate in competitions and events. It was started by my friends (<a href="http://www.jonatanpedersen.com/" target="_blank">Jonatan Pedersen</a> among others) in 1998, and quickly grew to have over 300 members. In total eight parties were held, primarily in Hillerød Handelsskole.</p>
		<p>I was part of the <a href="http://www.hnp.dk/crew.html" hreflang="da" rel="external">Organizer team</a> from <a href="http://www.hnp.dk/historie3.html" hreflang="da" rel="external">HNP #3</a> and onwards, and was responsible for the main website, handling member registration and a table booking service for the upcoming parties, as well as a history section with competition results and reviews. Additionally I developed internal web services for the parties, handling the tournament game plans and player statistics.<br />
		The systems were based on <abbr title="Active Server Pages 3.0">ASP</abbr> and an MS Access database, and later moved to PHP and MySQL on Linux servers. We also hosted a large array of game servers for all the most popular games, which ran on a variety of *nix boxes. We used <abbr title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</abbr>-scripts for gathering statictics for player rankings, well before online gaming had adapted similar score boards.</p>

		<h3>Setting up</h3>

		<p>Here are some photos from one of the parties, held in Hillerødholmsskolen. The tables were arranged in sections, and setup so each seat had access to a 100 Mbit/s network connection and 2 AC plugs. The centre stage was for music events and projection of animation and movie competitions as well as game finals.</p>
