		<p>I started working for Sandberg in 2001 and have since then been responsible for all their websites and related systems. Sandberg was bought in 2006 by the IT distributor <a href="eet.html">EET Nordic A/S</a>. I got hired by EET but continued to maintain and develop for Sandberg as a part of the EET group.</p>
		
		<p>As lead developer of all Sandberg's websites, I have handled both architectural and graphical design, and programmed their systems from the ground up. The first versions of the primary website were based on ASP 3.0 and an MS Access database. Most everything has been changed since then, and now all systems are running ASP.NET 4.0, AJAX and LINQ with MS SQL Server.</p>

				MeterMan was developed to help small and medium shops manage their Sandberg products, and organize them on racks.</p>
				<p class="l">It's based on AJAX for front end features and uses C# algorithms for business logic, on-the-fly PNG drawing etc.</p>

				The Sandberg Guide is meant to help customers navigate the many new types of technologies and the corresponding cables used to connect them.</p>
				<p class="l">It's a versatile system, able to determine how to connect e.g. a sound system to a computer, even if it requires joining multiple adapters and cables.</p>
