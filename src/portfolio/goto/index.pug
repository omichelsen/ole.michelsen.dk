h3 Electron and Node.js
p Implemented simultaneously as a hybrid standalone web app (SPA) and Electron desktop app. A lot of work went into taking the existing web platform, and bridging desktop APIs to extend capabilities like local disk recording, window management and auto startup.

p The architecture allows for teams to ship features independently of each other and without being tied to the release schedule of the desktop binary. We went from doing quarterly releases to shipping every single day. An advanced update system allows users to lock in a version or receive updates at night or while the system is idle.
