      a(href='../eet/') EET Group
      | , and the website is based on the platform I developed for them. This includes a web shop and order status with track and trace, as well as customer support functions such as return shipment handling.
    p
      | The site features a different layout from the normal EET Group theme, with slight modifications to some of the pages in form of product category presentation etc.
    p
      | An additional support site was created to allow for download of the many manuals and special software pertaining to the products. This was also created using ASP.NET MVC, and is directory/file based to allow for easy updates.
