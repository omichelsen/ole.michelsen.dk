		p <a href="https://regexcrossword.com">Regex Crossword Mobile</a> is the app version of <a href="/portfolio/regexcrossword">Regex Crossword</a>, the popular regular expression crossword game. To work on a mobile device the whole UX had to be reimagined to support touch and a smaller screen size. It has an interactive tutorial to introduce newcomers to regular expressions and an improved puzzle builder allowing the community to contribute both grid and hexagonal puzzles. A <a href="https://regexcrossword.com/leaderboard">leaderboard</a> tracks the top 50 players.

		p The game is developed as a <abbr title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr> and featurred in the native app stores for both iOS and Android. It's using HTML5 API's for drag and drop and service workers to be able to run offline.
